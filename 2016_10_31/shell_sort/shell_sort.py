# More swaps than necessary, but more elegant and easier to understand
# Extraneous swaps can easily be removed, when optimization is required
# The examples of this online show premature optimization in my opinion
# which obfuscates the structure of the algorithm. It's kind of funny
# that most versions use the version with fewer swaps while also using
# the version with the simplest gap sequence, which also results in the
# worst case time complexity of Î¸(N^2) when N = 2^p.

# One of the obfuscations that is particularly annoying is putting an
# unnecessary conjunction in the loop case,

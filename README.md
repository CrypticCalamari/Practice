# Practice
Simply Practice. Folder for each day I practice programming something.

Before I would create a folder called 'quicksort' for example and then practice writing a quicksort, but what if I wanted to practice writing a quicksort again from memory? Well, then I would choose a different language and have a separate file in the same folder. Well, what if I ran out of languages to practice in? Do I scrap an old file and start over? How would I see my progress?

Sure, I could use git's version control features and create separate branches, but that might end up seeming odd to an outside observer and the practice wouldn't necessarily be all under one roof so to speak, and what if I wanted to diverge from practicing either Algorithms or Data Structures? Well I'd have to create a semantically different repository for that.

With a repo specificlly for practice, I have something simple and intuitive, dedicated to simply practicing programming. I'll create a new folder named after the current date for each day I practice something, scrapping anything from the previous day, because it's simply practice. I'm repeating myself a bit here, but that's in order to hammer home the point that this is just practice and not meant to look like finished code.

That being said, I will not go back and modify old repositories I used for practice. Just keep in mind that older repositories may contain practice, and you can obviously assume that anything unfinished is practice ... practice, practice, practice ... now I'm just trying to make the word 'practice' seem odd to you when you say or type it by repeating it over and over ... I should go to bed ...
